# Enable Service Profiler for ASP.NET Core application in Visual Studio
Enable Service Profiler for ASP.NET Core application in Visual Studio is easy. We will walk through the basic steps.

## Create the ASP.NET Core Web Application with Docker Support
Let's start by creating an ASP.NET Core Web Application, we will name it `EnableSPInVS`. You can choose to start with an existing project as well.

During the creation of the project, we will enable the docker support like this:

![DockerSupport](./.media/DockerSupport.png)

The same goal could be reached by adding docker support to an existing project like it here: [Visual Studio Tools for Docker with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/visual-studio-tools-for-docker).

## Enable Application Insights
Add support for application insights by using the context menu: `Add` | `Application Insights Telemetry...` and then follow the wizard:

![AddApplicationInsights](./.media/AddApplicationInsights.png)

For detailed step by step instructions, please reference [Application Insights for ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-asp-net-core).

At the end of the wizard, it is expected to see Application Insights being fully configured.

## Add a reference to ServiceProfiler
Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, choose `Manage NuGet Packages...` and the reference to the NuGet Package of `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore`.

![Add NuGet package of Service Profiler](./.media/AddNuGetPackageOfServiceProfiler.png)

Then, we need to add the environment variable of `ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES` to the `docker-compose.yaml` like this:
```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  appinsightsprofilerexample:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY}appinsightsprofilerexample
    environment:
      "ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES": "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore"
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: AppInsightsProfilerExample/Dockerfile
```
Save and build the project. F5 for a Debug. In the output window, it is expected to see the Service Profiler logs in the Debug level:

![Service Profiler logs in VS Output Window](./.media/ServiceProfilerLogInVSOutput.png)

Keep the application running for 2 minutes, access the website to generate some traffic. At the end of the session, you will see the logs like it below:

```log
Service Profiler session finished. Samples: 14
ServiceProfiler.EventPipe.Client.Schedules.TraceSchedule:Information: Service Profiler session finished. Samples: 14
```

Give it a few minutes for the trace to arrive the Cloud, and then the trace will become available in the `Performance Blade` of the Application Insights resource created in the previous step:

![Performance Blade with Service Profiler Traces](./.media/performance-blade.png)

## Publish to App Service
Before publishing, optionally, it will be helpful if we set the minimum logging level to Information for Service Profiler in appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "IncludeScopes": false,
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning",
      // Add the following line
      "ServiceProfiler": "Information"
    }
  },
  // Other settings ...
}
```
Now we are going to publish the project to Azure App Service. Right-click on the project and choose `Publish`, and select `App Service Linux` like it below:

![Publish Target of App Service Linux](./.media/PublishTarget.png)

Follow the wizard to configure the App Service:

![Create App Service](./.media/CreateAppService.png)

## Add Settings for the App Service in the Azure Portal

```
ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES=Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore
APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY=0f1b2415-9a4f-4da1-9d26-replacewithyourown
```
It will looks like this:

![Set Environment Variables](./.media/SetEnvInPortal.png)

**Note**: The setting of the Application Insights instrumentation key should be optional. However, we have a bug in Service Profiler that requires it to be available for now.

Restart your app, the Service Profiler will be turned on and gathering trace for 2 minutes. Try to generate some traffic to your app during that period. If everything is hooked up correctly, you will start to see the traces after 5 to 10 minutes just like when you see the traces in the debug session.

Give it a try and if there's any question, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Profiler-AspNetCore/issues).
